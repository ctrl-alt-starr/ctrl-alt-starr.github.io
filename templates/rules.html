        <h3>RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE :</h3> <h3><b>1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</b>
        <br><b> 2. You are O(moon), your friend (or the computer ) is X(star). Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</b>
        <br><b> 3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</b>
        <br><b> 4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</b></h3>
        <br>
        <h3>RULES FOR TAC-TIC-TOE:</h3>
        <h3><b> Here instead of getting three in a row, you should try not to get three in a row. If you get three in a row, you lose!</b></h3>
        <br>
        <h3>RULES FOR 'YOUR CHOICE TIC-TAC-TOE' :</h3>
        <h3><b>What’s the same as playing the regular game is that you take turns as you usually do.</b><br>
        <b>What’s different is that you don’t start by deciding who is X(star)and who is O(moon). </b><br>
        <b>Instead, on your turn, you may write either an X(star) or an O(moon) in any empty square,</b><br>
        <b>and you can change your mind from turn to turn. So can your opponent. </b><br>
        <b>Also, you cannot place the first move on the centre square.</b><br>
        <b>The winner is the same as in the regular game―whoever completes a row with three Xs(stars)</b><br>
        <b>or three Os (moons) wins―whether or not that player actually wrote them all.</b><br></h3>
