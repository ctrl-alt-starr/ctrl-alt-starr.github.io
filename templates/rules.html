            RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE :<br>
            1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares. 
          <br>
            2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. <br>
            3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. <br>
            4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie. <br>
            RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE Numbers :<br>
            Assign one player the even numbers between 1 and 9(2,4,6, and 8)
            and assign the odd numbers to the other player (1,3,5,7, and 9). 
            The player with the odd numbers goes first. The first player
            writes an odd number in one of the spaces. The second player 
            then plays an even number in an attempt to get three numbers 
            in a row that equals 15. The rows may be vertical, horizontal, 
            or diagonal.Each number can only be played once.Play continues 
            until one player wins by totaling 15 in a line or all the spaces are filled. 
            Players swap even and odd numbers for the next match.<br>
            RULES FOR TAC-TIC-TOE :<br>
            Same rules as Tic-Tac-Toe but here you have to loose instead of winning.
